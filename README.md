# Wedding-Site

Summary:
This project is my first introduction to code. I wanted to create the website for my wedding from scratch so I dove into HTML and CSS on my own and have been working through a comprehensive Javascript course on Udemy. Exploring how the three languages work together is a personal project to suplement the Javascript course and reinforce fundamental HTML and CSS.

Goals:
-- Practice fundamental HTML and CSS
-- Practice problem solving and researching (stack overflow, google, youtube, etc)
-- Utilize javascript for user interaction
-- Project planning reinforcement
-- After acheiving functionality, improve overall UI/UX through collaboration with a designer
-- Gain exposure to GitHub workflow principles

Development Roadmap:
-- Acheive functionality
-- Review with with designer/other coders to refine UI/UX and clean code
-- Go public NLT 1/15/22
