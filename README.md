# Wedding-Site

Summary:
This project is my first introduction to code. I wanted to create the website for my wedding from scratch so I dove into HTML and CSS on my own and have been working through a comprehensive Javascript course on Udemy. Exploring how the three languages work together is a personal project to suplement the Javascript course and reinforce fundamental HTML and CSS.

Goals:
-- Practice fundamental HTML and CSS
-- Practice problem solving and researching (stack overflow, google, youtube, etc)
-- Utilize javascript for user interaction
-- Project planning reinforcement
-- Understand organizational best practices
-- Gain exposure to GitHub workflow principles

Development Roadmap:
Since this is my first solo project not supported by an established course, my focus is on functionality. Once I have achieved that, I will dive into refactoring the code to maximize efficiency.
