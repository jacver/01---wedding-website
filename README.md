Summary:
My first introduction to code is a comprehensive Javascript course I'm working on through Udemy. It touches very lightly on HTML and CSS, but seeing the power of the three languages interacting was exciting. This is a personal project to complete alongside my Javascript studies to simultaneously reinforce fundamental HTML and CSS basics.

Goals:
-- Practice fundamental HTML and CSS
-- Practice problem solving and researching (stack overflow, google, youtube, etc)
-- Utilize javascript for user interaction, ease, and aesthetics
-- Project planning reinfocement
-- Understand organizational best practices
-- Gain exposure to GitHub workflow principles

Development Roadmap:
Since this is my first solo project not supported by an established course, my focus is on functionality. Once I have achieved that, I will dive into refactoring the code to maximize efficiency.
